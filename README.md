# dayPlanner
<h1> Project Description</h1>
<p> This application is a workday schedule where the user can write and save tasks and reminders throughout the day. The hour blocks change color depending on if they are in the past, present, or future depending on the current time. In this project I used HTML,CSS and Javascript. I also used the assitance of moment.js for the time elements. I also used the assitance of bootstrap for styling the page and jquery to shorten the javascript code some.</p>
